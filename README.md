# Project_Book_Exchange_Frontend

## Description

Bookexchange is a web application created to **exchange books with other users**.


The user can upload books to the page so that other users can add the books of interest to their wish lists.


If two users agree on interests in the other's books, they can contact and register the change on the website.


## Technical structure

The front end has been carried out with **ReactJs** and styled with CSS and bootstrap.

The Heroku application has been used for the deployment.
